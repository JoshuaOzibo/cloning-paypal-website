            <p>Pay in 3 is an unregulated credit agreement, so you will have fewer protections under this agreement than you would under a regulated credit agreement. Carefully consider whether the purchase is affordable and how you will make the repayments. Be aware of the possible impact of using Pay in 3 and of missing payments, including making other borrowing more difficult or more expensive. You may find our Spend Smarter Guide helpful.
